I developed a software that calculates the distribution of bonuses for employees in a communications company,      
using MVC design pattern.             
As part of my work at a Cellular company,    I developed a software that helped the 
company's manager enter each employee's working hours and sales for every product he sold.   
The software was a better alternative to the manual calculation made by the manager.    
The program was written in JAVA language.
